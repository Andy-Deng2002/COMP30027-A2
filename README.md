## Environment Setup

This project uses `conda` for local environment management and a `requirements.txt` file for cloud deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud.

1. **Local Setup (using Conda):**
   Create the conda environment from the provided `environment.yml` file:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```
   Then, activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate COMP30027_A2
   ```

2. **Cloud Deployment (Streamlit Cloud):**
   The `requirements.txt` file is automatically used by Streamlit Community Cloud for deployment. No manual steps are needed if you are deploying from the GitHub repository.

## Running the Models
Execute the notebooks in the following order:

1. Train CNN and SVM/XGBoost models (can be run in parallel):
   - `cnn.ipynb` (~30 minutes)
   - `xgboost_svm.ipynb` (~30 minutes)

2. Run ensemble model:
   - `ensemble_model.ipynb` (after both base models are trained)

## Note
- Ensure you have sufficient computational resources
- Models will be saved in the `models` directory
- The results on test set will be saved in the `results` directory and named as 'submission_{model_name}.csv'

## Data and Models Setup
The `data/`, `models/`, and `results/` directories are not tracked by Git. You need to download them from the following link and place them in the project's root directory:

[Download Data, Models, and Results from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I2JZidA8NJzks_IPo5PfXVbDV0BErs2i/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading and unzipping, your project structure should look like this:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/
â”œâ”€â”€ results/
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
â”œâ”€â”€ environment.yml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Live Demo

You can access the interactive web application for model visualization and error analysis via the following link.

The application is deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud. Please note that the app may go into hibernation due to inactivity and might take a moment to wake up on the first visit.
